# Don't Hold This Code Against Me!

This is literally the first Python code I've ever written. Not only that, but I deliberately didn't Google, read docs, etc. for better ways to do things, but simply used what [Google's Python Class](http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/) taught so that I'd do the exercises "like they wanted me to" and make sure I got the fundamentals that the exercises were teaching down. 

So I'm a much better programmer than this code suggests. Many times, I said "if this were Ruby I'd do this much more elegantly." If you're thinking of hiring me or something, don't use this as evidence that I suck at coding. I have lots of other repos that you can use for that ;)
